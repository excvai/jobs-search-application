## 🌐 Company Logos

Company logos are fetched using the [Ninjas Logo API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/logo).  
Please note that the API does not provide logos for all companies, so some job detail pages (`/job-details/:id`) may not display a logo. This is a known limitation of the external service.

## ⚠️ Route Customization

Although the original task suggested using the `/jobs` route, I intentionally opted to use the root `/` route for job listings.
